# Portfolio README

This is a repository for my personal portfolio website built using React. Below, you'll find information about the structure of the project, the technologies used, and how you can contribute to its development.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend

- **React:** The entire portfolio is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows for the creation of reusable UI components and facilitates the management of state within the application.
- **JavaScript (JSX):** JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript often used with React to describe the UI components. It allows for the mixing of HTML and JavaScript, making the code more readable and efficient.
- **HTML:** HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. In this project, HTML is used to structure the content of each page.
- **CSS:** Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used for styling the portfolio, defining the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of the website.

### Additional Frameworks and Libraries

- **react-awesome-reveal:** Utilized for animating elements on the page, adding dynamic and engaging transitions.
- **framer-motion:** Used for creating animations and transitions, enhancing the overall user experience.
- **react-scroll:** Integrated for smooth scrolling functionality, providing seamless navigation between sections of the portfolio.
